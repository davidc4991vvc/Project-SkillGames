 Came across an issue at work with the overflow auto scroll bar. It worked fine in most browsers, but on windows it not only looked ugly, but added unwanted space to the div (the container in question had a fixed width). A google search came up with little good alternatives other than the no scroll bar hack above, which can be confusing from a user experience standpoint. The content may be placed in a way though to imply more content further down. Customizing the scrollbar is another option but isn't supported in IE or Firefox.
